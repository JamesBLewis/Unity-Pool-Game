# Unity Pool/Billiards Game
A simple pool/billiards game I made in unity, written in javascript as a proof of concept. Currently fully functional, i'll continue to update it in my spare time and hopefully make into a playable game :)

## Todo List
In no particular order...
* Add multiplayer.
* Port to browsers.
* Port to mobile devices.
* make it look pretty.
* conform to pool rules.
* balance physics.
* add icons and nice graphics.
* add customization options.
